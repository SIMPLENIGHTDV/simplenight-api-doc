## How to edit the *swagger.yaml* file

1. When in *https://github.com/SIMPLENIGHTDV/simplenight-api-doc*, press the dot button from your keyboard and an editor screen will open in the browser.
2. Please select the file *swagger.yaml* at the bottom of the list at the left of the screen.
Because of the formatting the file has, I recommend using *Ctrl + F* to search through the text.
3. When changes are done, select the *Source Control* icon (*Ctrl + Shift + G*). You will see the changes list with the files that you have made changes to.
4. Click on the "+" icon at the right of the file name in the list to save those changes.
5. Write a message in the Message text bot at the bottom of the list. It is recommended to write a brief description such as "Syntax and spelling corrections".
6. Click on the “✓” icon, is the third icon at the right from "Source Control" title at top of the changes list.
7. Locate the “…” icon and click on it. A menu will pop up with multiple options. What we need in this case to push the commit to the remote repository. Click on the “Push” button to send the changes to the remote repository and that's all!
8. Optional: Check if the changes are done.
